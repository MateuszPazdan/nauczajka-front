## 📝 Description

Nauczajka is a web application that connects tutors with students, offering a complete system for managing tutoring services online. Users can register either as students or tutors, and depending on their role, gain access to different features.

Students can search for tutors using advanced filters such as subject, teaching method, location, rating, and price. They can view detailed tutor profiles, including availability, teaching style, and subjects offered. Once they find a match, students can contact tutors through a built-in chat system, book lessons, and leave reviews with a star rating and comments. Each student also has a personal profile with basic settings like profile photo, password management, and account deletion.

Tutors can fully manage their public profiles by editing descriptions, updating skills, adding subjects, and setting available time slots. They can communicate with students via chat and receive feedback through the rating system visible to other users.

Registration is required to interact with tutors, but the search engine is available to all users, even without logging in. This ensures that anyone can explore available tutoring offers quickly and efficiently.
